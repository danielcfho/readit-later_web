# ActionsCam – Learn Languages by Moving!

Ready to make language learning fun, active, and engaging? ActionsCam is your go-to iOS app that transforms how you learn languages by combining real-world actions with immersive, interactive learning. Wave, jump, or sit—ActionsCam instantly recognizes your movements through your iPhone’s camera and teaches you how to say them in your target language. It’s learning by doing, made simple and exciting!

## Why ActionsCam Stands Out
* Dynamic Action Recognition: Unlike other apps stuck with static images, ActionsCam uses cutting-edge video analysis to understand your movements in real time, turning every step or gesture into a language lesson.
* Privacy First, Offline Ready: Powered by a local, open-source model, your data stays on your device—no internet needed, no privacy worries. Learn anywhere, anytime, securely.
* No Apple Intelligence Required: Don’t have the latest iPhone? No problem! ActionsCam runs smoothly on iPhone XR and above, using a lightweight, high-performance model built for everyone.

## Key Features

* Multi-Language Support: Powered by Apple’s native translation API, ActionsCam supports a wide range of languages to match your learning goals.
