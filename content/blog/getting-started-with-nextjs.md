# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework for building fast, SEO-friendly web applications. This guide will help you get started with the basics of Next.js.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers the following key features:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Renders pages on each request, ensuring fresh data.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time, serving static HTML.
- **API Routes**: Build your API directly into your Next.js app.
- **File-based Routing**: Create pages by adding files to the `pages` directory.
- **Built-in CSS & Sass Support**: Import CSS and Sass files directly in your components.

## Installation

To create a new Next.js app, run the following commands:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

## Pages & Routing

Next.js uses a file-based routing system:

- Create files in the `pages/` directory to define routes.
- Dynamic routes can be created using brackets, e.g., `[id].js`, `[slug].js`.

## Data Fetching

Next.js provides several methods for data fetching:

- `getStaticProps`: Fetch data at build time for static generation.
- `getServerSideProps`: Fetch data on each request for server-side rendering.
- `getStaticPaths`: Generate dynamic routes for static pages.

## API Routes

You can create API endpoints within your Next.js app:

- Create files in `pages/api/` to define API routes.
- Example: `pages/api/hello.js` becomes `/api/hello`.

## Deploying

Deploying your Next.js app is simple:

- You can deploy to Vercel with one click.
- Next.js also supports static export and custom server setups.
